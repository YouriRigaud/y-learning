# y-learning
y-learning : my personal ML library from scratch

## Repository structure
- tests: tests directory for the y-learning library
- ylearn: y-learning library source code

## How tests work
To test the library, I compare my estimators with the state-of-art ML library scikit-learn.

## Next things to do
- String labels classifier
- Lasso, ElasticNet linear model
- Gradient descent solver
- Test base class for ease of use
